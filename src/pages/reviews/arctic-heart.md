Some people would look at the tagline of *Arctic Heart* and dismiss it outright. But not me!! A woman injects herself with penguin DNA in an attempt to woo a prestigious scientist &mdash; sounds promising. I'm not much of a guy for romance films, but I figured that this could be a good entry point...I was *almost* right. But definitely not.

This film was one of the most puzzling films I've ever seen, not because it is vague or abstract &mdash; it's quite the opposite &mdash; but because it spends eighty minutes using a bizarre premise to paint a solid, if exaggerated, illustration of how a codependent relationship can lead to abuse, and then tosses it all away in the final ten minutes.

In *Arctic Heart*, a woman's infatuation leads her to do anything and everything to try to fulfill the wishes of her crush, the researcher that employs her. She injects herself with a potentially dangerous and unapproved compound to get close to him, and submits herself to dehumanizing and abusive tests (the very first of which is literally physical abuse). Like the goofy premise, this sequence is presented with a quirky and cute tone, when it's actually disturbing, and reflective of real abuse that can occur in codependent relationships or relationships with an imbalance of power. 

So continues the bulk of the film, in which the protagonist's only method of control is also abusive &mdash; she makes herself indispensable to her boss's research, and then uses that position to coerce him into having sex with her (for scientific purposes, of course). 

It's only when it becomes clear that the protagonist is suffering irreparable harm that her boss begins to fall for her, but by that time, she seems to have figured out that she's harming herself to please him, and that she has to separate herself from him. When he asks to accompany her to Antarctica (she's becoming a penguin person, and penguin-people can only live in Antarctica, of course), she denies him, saying she needs to do it alone.

Hell yes! Now that's a decently satisfying end to a sad story. She'll carry the scars of the relationship forever, but she stood up for herself, and rejected everything she thought she wanted to wrestle back her independence and separate herself from a toxic relationship. Good ending!

Just kidding, the movie doesn't end there. The scientist, without consulting her, injects himself with Penguin DNA and shows up unbidden at her iceberg on the South Pole, and they get together again despite the fact that they're terrible for each other and sexually incompatible (which is unambiguously established earlier in the film). The End.

Seriously, whose idea was this. Is this a thing in the romance genre? Proving over the course of ninety minutes that a relationship is shitty and abusive, and then they live happily ever after? It kind of feels like it might be, though I haven't seen enough to know. I'd give this movie a solid 2/5 for two reasons: one, they had the guts to go there with the whole penguin thing; and two, if they'd just had the guts to end it ten minutes earlier, the film could have actually had a decent message.
